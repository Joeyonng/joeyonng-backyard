# Joeyonng's Backyard

This repository houses the source code of Joeyonng's personal backyard, and it is live on https://joeyonng.github.io/.

As time goes by, I will throw more features, applications and maybe personal stories to my backyard.

## Why

This site serves as my personal website, as well as a demo for the component library [react-big-sur][1] that I built for 
fun. 

This site is still in an early development and is far from a perfect copy of the real desktop experience (also lots of 
bugs), but I already got lots of joys developing it.

## Related Works

If you like the design of my backyard, please also check out these awesome repositories, which are very helpful in my 
development of my backyard.
- The idea is heavily inspired by [winXP](https://github.com/ShizukuIchi/winXP), from which I learned how to switch 
  between different Apps. 
- It turns that I am not the first one to think of implementing web based macOS Big Sur UI.
  [macos-web](https://github.com/PuruVJ/macos-web) and [playground-macos](https://github.com/Renovamen/playground-macos)
  are two finner, more efficient and more professional implementations of the same idea.
- The dock is adapted from [react-osx-dock](https://github.com/lukehorvat/react-osx-dock). I never thought state can be
used to do the animations frame by frame.
